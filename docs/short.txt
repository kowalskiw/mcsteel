1. Setting up multisimulation configuration (examples included in '/config' directory); file name is the same
 as case_title if not specified below:
	a) .USER file -- user configuration (config-, results-, SAFIR-path, miu, simulation time, RSET, fire type,
	case title, maximum number of iterations);
	b) .FUL file -- fuel properties (coordinates, HRRPUA, partial probability of ignition, time of sprinkler 
	activation, fire growth factor if needed) OR b1) + b2)
	b1) .FUEL file -- fuel properties (HRRPUA, partial probability of ignition, time of sprinkler activation)
	b2) .STP file -- geometry of the fuel sites, parallelepipeds included as GiD volumes, layer's names reffer
	to the .FUEL 'name' columns;
	c) .DXF file -- geometry of the structure;
	d) profiles' .GID projects -- already calculated with ISO fire curve, names reffer to layers name in
	'frame.gid' and DXF as well;
	e) structure's .GID project -- already calculated with ISO fire curve, named 'frame'.

2. Running multisimulation is ment to be llowing commands:
	a) 'python path\to\mcsteel\mc.py path\to\user\configuration.user' -- generating a set of simulations using
	the Monte Carlo script, returns 'title_set.CSV' file and directories with simulations' input files in 
	results_path directory;
	b) 'python path\to\mcsteel\multi.py path\to\user\configuration.user' -- running each simulation and adding
	the results of each to 'title.results.csv' file, returns also 'results.TXT' summary file and distributions
	'dist_d.PNG' and 'dist_p.PNG'; /supporting clusters available soon/
	c) python path\to\mcsteel\selsim.py path\to\user\configuration.user -- running the worst, in terms of
	effects (time to critical temperature exceeding), percentile of scenarios to global analyses of	the
	structure; returns \worst directory with global analyses files.
	
3. There is possibility and sense to run some scripts alone:
	a) fdsafir.py -- args=(model, calctype='s3dt2d, path='.')
		- model - 'ISO' if you want to calculate simulation with current heating, it does not change heating
		  information and run Thermal2D simulations as a MAKE.TEM type; 'LCF' if you want to change FISO
		  frontiers to LOCAFI flux and run Thermal2D simulations as a MAKE.TEMLF type.
		- calctype - 's3d' to calculate only Structural3D frame.gid project; 't2d' to calculate all .gid
		  projects except frame.gid; 's3dt2d' or 't2ds3d' to calculate both frame.gid Structural3D and other Thermal2D projects
		- path - path to case directory.
	Case directory should contain frame.gid (Structural3D) and profile.gid (Thermal2D) for each section used
	in the frame.gid. GID extended dirs should contain at least IN file. See fdsafir_docs.txt for further
	information.
